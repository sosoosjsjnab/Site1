				Any person needs personal space. The child also needs it. That is why the growing up of the baby, sooner or later, will certainly lead the parents to the need to resolve the issue of arranging a separate room for him. At the same time, fathers and mothers should keep in mind that when planning a repair, you will need to take into account all the requirements for such a room. For example, when choosing building materials, you need to pay attention only to those that will be as safe as possible for the health of their child, but at the same time will withstand active games and decent loads.

						Even before the repair is carried out, it is advisable to inquire about the wishes and tastes of the child. After all, he is already old enough to express his opinion. How to carry out work in a room intended for a baby, so that a childhood dream comes true in it? Preliminary design Repair in the nursery, as well as in any other room, when deciding to carry out more or less large-scale work, will require a preliminary plan. It will not be difficult to create it if the parents are clearly defined with the ultimate goal. That is why it is recommended to start repairing a children's room with a design project. This is quite feasible on your own with a minimum of skills. First of all, you need to determine the parameters of the room allocated for the child. In this case, the width, height and length of the future children's room are measured. It is also necessary to clarify the dimensions of door and window openings, their specific location. In the event that there are non-standard architectural elements in the room, their measurements are also necessary before starting repairs in the nursery. The data obtained will make it possible to draw up a room plan, which is drawn on a sheet or entered into a special computer program. When using the latter option, the future design of the room can be presented virtually. Such a program allows you to change the color of the walls, the size of the window, the width of the passage, change the layout, etc. Many companies and private firms offer to carry out a computer design before repairing a children's room in Moscow. You can also find professionals in other cities in various regions of the country. After passing this stage, you can begin to think about the organization of the space, including the arrangement of furniture, lighting, general design, etc. Carrying out such planning will allow you to avoid possible mistakes during repairs in the nursery and clearly imagine its future interior. When renovating a children's apartment, special attention should be paid. When creating a project for a little man, it is necessary to take into account those specific features that apply to such a room. They relate to the following: The need for space zoning. The fact is that the children's room is designed to perform a large number of functions. In this regard, a work and play area, as well as a place for storing things, must be allocated in it. Each of these parts will need original finishing. That is why it is so important to determine in advance the location of the main zones. Renovating a nursery for two will require the allocation of common and personal space. Moreover, each of the individual zones can be decorated in a specific color and style. After drawing up the project, they begin to determine the list of necessary work, as well as their sequence, estimate the repair budget and draw up a list of necessary materials.

						Dismantling work How to make repairs in the nursery? To do this, having in hand a planned action plan, the first thing they do is begin to take out all the equipment and furniture. After that, it is time to dismantle the finish that is planned to be changed. If this is provided for by the design project, then unnecessary partitions are demolished at this stage. However, it should be borne in mind that such work must be coordinated with the relevant authorities. If a simple repair of a children's room is envisaged, without replacing the floor covering, then it must be securely covered with a film during the work. The method of dismantling old finishing materials will directly depend on their type. For example, wallpaper glued to the walls is pre-moistened and removed using a spatula. If you need to remove the paint, then a special solvent will help to do this. Whitewashing from the ceiling is removed in several stages. First, it must be washed off with warm water, and then cleaned off with a spatula. The final stage of removing the whitewash is wiping the surface with a damp sponge. As a rule, there are no problems with flooring. Dismantling laminate or linoleum, which are used most often, is easy enough. Wiring What work is carried out at the next stage of the renovation of the children's room? If it is necessary to replace the electrical wiring, special attention is paid to it. In this case, the walls will need to be chipped, which must be done only before the start of finishing work. In this case, you should rely on the already drawn up project, on which the lighting points are marked. The plan should also indicate the places where the installation of equipment is provided. At this stage of the renovation, lighting is organized in the nursery. You need to make it multilevel. In the children's room, not only general light is needed, but also lighting in the area where the child will rest and sleep. For such premises, the best option would be built-in light bulbs. Children will not be able to break such lamps even if they play active games in the room.

						The only drawback of built-in lighting is the need to use suspended or suspended ceilings. If their device is not provided for by the project, then a chandelier can be bought for the nursery, which must have a plastic lampshade. Do not forget about the need to equip lighting near the desktop and bed. It is recommended that when repairing in a nursery, provide for the possibility of using a decorative lamp in it. In the event that a computer is supposed to be installed in the room, several sockets will need to be installed in the wall at once. They are also placed in all those points where electrical appliances will be located in the future. It should be borne in mind that it is best to purchase sockets with overlays for a children's room. Rough finishing of walls In the event that the repair project provides for the need to erect partitions or any unusual architectural elements, then their construction is carried out at this stage. After that, they begin to level the walls. This will allow for perfect finishing in the future. To level the walls in the children's room, take putty or plaster, pre-treating the surface with a primer. A good alternative to these dirty jobs is to use drywall sheets. The installation process of this material is not only clean, but also quite fast in time. As a result, the walls are perfectly flat and smooth. Sometimes parents use drywall to make very interesting volumetric solutions that allow them to give the room a special atmosphere. The only drawback of this option is the need to build a frame, which will somewhat reduce the area of ​​the room. Preparation of ceilings Above this surface will also have to work carefully, especially if you plan to cover it with paint or plaster. Usually, gypsum mortar is used to level the ceilings. After application to the surface, it is thoroughly cleaned and primed. It is not required to bring the ceiling to an ideal state if tension or suspended structures are attached to it. Floor preparation This surface must be leveled before finishing. With significant differences for such work, a cement-sand screed is sometimes used. But, as a rule, they get by with a self-leveling mixture. It is poured several times with an interval of 40 minutes. In this case, you will need to walk over the surface with a roller. This will allow excess air to escape from the mixture. After completing this process, work in the nursery is stopped for two days. This time should be enough for the applied material to harden. In a children's room, a system of warm floors will be very appropriate. A pre-prepared project will help determine their location. For example, they do not need to be laid in areas where the furniture will stand.

				Installation of windows This stage also requires close attention when performing repairs in the nursery. If the windows in the room are old, then parents need to take care of replacing them with modern double-glazed windows. Such structures will reliably protect the baby's room from heat and cold coming from the street, as well as from noise and drafts. When choosing a window, you need to pay attention to the presence of a ventilation mode or a special valve in it. This function will provide normal ventilation of the room. At this stage of the repair work, if necessary, the doors are replaced. Before the end of the repair, it is advisable to close them with polyethylene, fixed with masking tape. This will prevent building materials from entering the new door leaf, which can stain it. Fine finishing These works are carried out in a strictly defined sequence. They begin to perform them from the ceiling. This will allow you not to stain the finished walls later. When decorating the ceiling in the nursery, various options can be used. Painting. Safe materials are taken for her. After finishing painting, the ceiling surface can be decorated with painted stars or glowing stickers. Decorative plaster. This type of finish is a great alternative to painting. Materials for making such plaster are completely safe. Wallpaper. For finishing the ceiling in the nursery, they are taken in one color, if the interior of the room will have a large number of bright elements, or bright with the image of the heroes of your favorite cartoons or clouds. Whitewash. This option for finishing the ceiling is budgetary, but short-lived. Today, when making repairs in a nursery for a boy or for a girl, they often use tension structures or suspended ceilings. Their installation does not take much time and is not accompanied by dirty work. In this case, the ceilings are mounted after finishing the walls and floor. When choosing materials for walls, you should take care of their safety, environmental friendliness, durability and ease of maintenance. In this case, most often purchased wallpaper made of natural materials that can pass air. In this case, you can stay at the simplest and most budgetary option. They will be paper wallpapers. Other types of this material will work as well. For example, cork and non-woven wallpapers, as well as those made on the basis of wood veneer or serpyanka, bamboo and reed, jute, straw, etc.

				Another option for finishing the walls is painting them. Moreover, the priority in this case will be a water emulsion, as well as those compositions on the label of which there is an indication that they are to be used in rooms for children. In some areas, blackboard and magnetic paint can be applied. Such areas will create an entertainment area for the baby. A good finishing material for walls is fabric and decorative plaster. After completing these works, go to the floor. Its decoration should also be considered carefully. After all, the child will spend a considerable part of his time on the floor. A safe finishing material must be selected for the nursery. It is desirable that it is warm and natural, and also easy to clean. The most suitable floor material in this case is wood. However, not everyone is satisfied with the need for constant care. An alternative to wood is parquet board, as well as laminate. A cork is considered an excellent option for arranging the floor in a child's room. It is durable, non-slippery, environmentally friendly and warm. PVC tiles and linoleum are suitable for a children's room. Only when purchasing them is it necessary to clarify the availability of a product safety certificate. Often in the room for the child, parents decide to lay the carpet. It is pleasant to the touch and soft. It is always warm and non-slip. However, carpet has one significant drawback. It accumulates dust, which is a strong allergen. Furniture After the repair of the children's room has been completed with your own hands, it remains to do the most pleasant thing. At this stage, furniture is selected and installed. It should be safe, ergonomic, comfortable and fit perfectly into the created interior. If repairs have been made in a small nursery, then this should be a set of the most necessary items. These include a desk and bed, bedside table, wardrobe or shelf system. If space permits, then the room can be equipped with a sports area, and poufs and sofas for older children. Also, parents may not buy interior items, but repair children's furniture if it was purchased earlier and has worn out and loosened somewhat during operation. How to choose suitable interior items for your child? It is advisable to buy furniture for a nursery made of wood or MDF. With a limited budget, you should pay attention to the one that is made of chipboard, while getting acquainted with the quality certificates. It should be borne in mind that such structures for formaldehyde emission should be classified as E1 or E0. Wicker and plastic furniture would be a good option for a children's room, but glass items must be discarded immediately. When buying upholstered furniture, you should pay attention to the upholstery material. It must be natural. Choose an orthopedic mattress for the bed.

						A room for a boy The main attribute of such a room is a sports corner. Its location should be determined even before the renovation of the boy's nursery begins.

There is a sleeping place at the top of such a bed. For the repair of a child's room for a boy, wallpapers and paints of green, blue, and also brown are well suited.

						For children of different sexes Repairs in the nursery for a boy and a girl cause particular difficulties. Indeed, two children of different sexes will live in one common bedroom. At the same time, comfortable conditions should be created for each of them, taking into account the existing preferences and tastes. But if you approach the matter competently, then such a task becomes quite solvable. You just need to split the space for a boy and a girl, using such techniques as different floor levels, colors of finishes, textiles, as well as installing a screen. As for the playing area, the guys can share it. The main thing is that there is enough space for it. But in general, the interior of the room, intended for two children, should create optimal conditions for each of them. That is, it should provide for two work areas, as well as two personal spaces in which one could retire and feel like a master.
